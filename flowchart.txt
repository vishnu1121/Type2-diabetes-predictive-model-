1. Importing the packages
2. Exploring the dataset - Diabetes Health Data
3. data processing using pandas dataframe
4. visualization using seaborn & matplotlib
5. Feature Selection and Data Splitting into train and test
6. building the model
	- SVM
	- Random Forest
	- Decision Tree
	- Naive Bayes
	- KNN
	- Voting Classifier
        - CNN
        - LSTM
        - ANN
	
7. training the model
8. building the model with Random Forest since it gives better score comparing with Other Models 

Note:

Extension - Voting Classifier, Decision Tree , Random Forest, CNN, LSTM , and ANN  is build as Extension for feature values
and Decision Tree is used for prediction since we it gives better Accuracy score value comparing with other Models
